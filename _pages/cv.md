RESEARCH INTERESTS
======
  After the study of artificial intelligence professional knowledge in my sophomore year, as well as the practice of
some projects and competitions, I think I have the knowledge foundation for scientific research and study, which
stimulates my enthusiasm for scientific research and study. I hope to conduct research on the following aspects and strive
to issue a paper:
* Deep learning
* LLM
* Computer vision
* Machine learning
  
OWN ADVANTAGE
======
**Own advantages for scientific research:**
* Many mathematical modeling competitions have made me have a deeper understanding of the writing of papers
and some algorithms, and I can integrate the skills contained in algorithms into artificial intelligence-related
scientific research, which is helpful for solving problems.
* Some project competitions let me know teamwork, so that I can better deal with the relationship with partners in
scientific research projects.
* GPA and competition are inseparable from long-term and intensive study, which will enable me to have higher
concentration in scientific research.
